# Rainydays

An e-commerce website for a fictitional outdoor clothing vendor as a course assignment for HTML and CSS Module, Front-End Development at Noroff.

## Description

The project comprises two parts, firstly prototyping in Figma and secondarily building a static website using HTML and CSS. 

The logo and product images were supplied by [Noroff](https://www.noroff.no/). However, the product images were replaced by content from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). The reason for doing this was that I believed that the website would look better having images of models wearing the products in an outdoor setting.

All the icons are taken form [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
